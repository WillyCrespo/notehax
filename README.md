Trying to make a 11.6 version of the 11.5 notehax

# Tutorial
First download the <a href="https://github.com/WillyCrespoGD/notehax/releases">notehax archive</a>
and then extract the private folder to the root of the (SD CARD) and make sure you have the 11.5 version of your 3ds firmware and a 1.3.1 of any region of Filpnote Studio 3D,if you delete your personal Private folder in your SD CARD /!\ Your notes you made are going to be __ERASED__ Â   Notes (__GONE__)

After done all of that,put the SD CARD back in 3DS,power it back on and open Filpnote Studio 3D
Go to your notes and you should see a note that has A thumbnail saying the HBL,select the note and press B or tap the note and the custom note will open the HBL/Homebrew Launcher (if you have __boot.3dsx__ and the __3ds__ folder in sd card)

# Things you need
You need
__boot.3dsx__ and __3ds__ folder
And the __Private__ folder

# Issues
__YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A 11.6 VERSION OF THIS SO THIS IS JUST COPYING THE HAX INTO THIS REPOSTIY OR IDK__

The description is fake
